Example: Unit Testing OCaml with OUnit
=============================

"[My favourite language!](http://ocaml.org)" the Gruffalo said.  
"But how do you test all those functions ahead?"

"How? " said the Mouse, bursting with laughter.  
"I'll go ahead and you follow after."

So the Mouse created this little project with the help from a video and API documentation from [OUnit website](http://ounit.forge.ocamlcore.org).

All was quiet in the deep dark wood.  
The Gruffalo found OUnit and the unit tests were good.  
And the Mouse got paid a lot.

As you can see, i like to plagiarise and i suck at poetry, too. But now, at least, i know how to unit test my OCaml code.
